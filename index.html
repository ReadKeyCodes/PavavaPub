        <p><em>"The voice of unheard voices"</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Parava Publications is a leading startup publications agency hoping to help young promising
            student authors get their books published and enter into the limelight of physical publishing.
            We exist to create opportunities where none seem available and to prove that meaningful
            publishing can begin at any scale.
        </p>

        <section id="pp-intro">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Parava Publications is a startup publishing agency founded with the motto “the voice of unheard
                voices.” We exist to give young, promising student authors an opportunity to step into the world
                of physical publishing—an industry that often feels inaccessible to newcomers. Our mission is to
                identify potential, nurture creativity, and transform manuscripts into professionally produced
                books that can stand confidently beside traditionally published works.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We believe that publishing should not be limited to established names or institutions.
                Parava Publications is built for writers who have something meaningful to say but lack the
                platform, resources, or guidance to bring their work into print.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="pp-about">
            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>
                Parava Publications was founded by a group of students who recognized a major gap in the publishing
                ecosystem. Talented young writers often struggle to find publishers willing to take a chance on
                new voices, especially when those voices come from student communities. Instead of waiting for
                validation, the founders chose to create their own publishing platform—one driven by learning,
                collaboration, and transparency.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                From its inception, Parava Publications has functioned as both a creative and organizational
                learning space. Each founding member contributes a specialized skill, allowing the publication
                to operate like a professional agency while remaining flexible and student-led. Although still
                in its early stages, Parava aims to grow into a recognized startup publishing agency that
                consistently supports student authors and brings their work into physical form.

        <h1>Services</h1>
        <p>
            The Services section of Parava Publications explains how we support student authors throughout the
            publishing process. By reading this section, authors and readers gain a clear understanding of what
            Parava offers, how our publishing pathways work, and what level of involvement an author can expect.
            Our goal is to remove confusion and replace it with clarity, trust, and realistic expectations.
        </p>

        <section id="service-htp">
            <h2>How to Publish?</h2>
            <p>
                Parava Publications offers a clear and supportive publishing process designed specifically for
                new and student authors. We understand that publishing can be intimidating, especially for
                first-time writers. Our approach emphasizes guidance, honesty, and collaboration. Every project
                begins with discussion and mutual understanding, ensuring that both the author’s vision and the
                publication’s standards are respected.
            </p>

            <section id="service-sptu">
                <h3>Self-Publish Through Us</h3>
                <p>
                    For authors who wish to retain full creative and intellectual control over their work,
                    Parava Publications provides a self-publishing pathway. In this model, authors publish
                    independently while receiving structured support from Parava. This includes editorial
                    assistance, layout and formatting, cover design, printing coordination, and guidance on
                    distribution.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The author remains the sole owner of the work, while Parava acts as a professional
                    facilitator, ensuring the book meets physical publishing standards without compromising
                    the author’s identity.
                </p>
                
            </section>

            <section id="service-wpfy">
                <h3>We Publish for You</h3>
                <p>
                    Parava Publications also offers a full publishing option for authors who prefer a more
                    guided experience. In this model, Parava takes responsibility for editing, visual identity,
                    layout, printing decisions, and marketing strategy. This option is designed for student
                    authors who may lack the resources or experience to manage publishing independently.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even in this structure, authors remain informed and involved. Parava prioritizes ethical
                    publishing practices and long-term author growth over short-term profit.

        <section id="service-buy">
            <h2>How to Buy Our Books?</h2>
            <p>
                Books published by Parava Publications are sold primarily through direct and community-based
                channels. This allows us to keep prices accessible while maintaining sustainability. Readers
                can purchase books through pre-orders, direct communication with Parava representatives, or
                authorized sellers associated with the publication.

            <br>
            <p>
